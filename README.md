# Stability Blockchain Message Submission dApp

A simple decentralized application (dApp) and React frontend that allows users to submit messages to the Stability Blockchain using our experimental [ZKT RPC](https://docs.stble.io/developers/zkt), with the option to post to either the Testnet or Mainnet. The application is built in React and provides real-time feedback, including a link to view the transaction in the Stability block explorer.

## Features

- **Submit Messages to Blockchain**: Allows users to post a message to either Stability's Testnet or Mainnet.
- **Transaction Confirmation**: Displays a confirmation message with a link to the transaction on Stabilityâ€™s block explorer.
- **Dynamic Network Selection**: Users can choose between Testnet and Mainnet, adjusting the RPC and block explorer URL accordingly.
